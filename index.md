## Welcome to my blog!

A place where I share everything computer science and mathematics related! I will be regularly posting about algorithms and mathematical ideas that I find interesting enough to share and teach. So have a look around and if there's something that you find interesting too, then my work is done! I will be typing everything on LaTeX to make it look professional so feel free to save a .pdf file of it if you find it interesting!
